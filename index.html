experience only in C++.</p>

<h7>A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had.
Include only what you can think of and write down in two minutes, maximum.</h7>
<p>An interesting fact about me is that I'm half-Norwegian. My father moved from Norway to the U.S.
when he was 10 years old, and became a U.S. citizen when I was a little kid. Every so often (about 2 years or so), my family and I will
travel to Norway to visit my grandparents, uncle, and my dad's extended family. My family and I visited Norway just since last summer
for the first time since Christmas of 2013. While I don't know Norwegian very well, I want to start learning the language once I have
graduated college.</p>
